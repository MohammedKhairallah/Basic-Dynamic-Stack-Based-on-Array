# Basic-Dynamic-Stack-Based-on-Array

### Overview:

This project demonstrates the implementation of a basic dynamic stack using an array in C. A stack is a linear data structure that follows the LIFO (Last In, First Out) principle. In a dynamic stack, the size of the stack can dynamically grow or shrink as elements are pushed or popped.
